# Three things must be done if you add new messages to the project:

## 1. please sort the list of commit messages before you submit the pull request.

For Linux / OSX users:

    $ sort commit_messages.txt > commit_messages.txt

For Windows users ... idk.


## Add yourself to the end of the list of `static/humans.txt` (if you're not already there)+

## Done those? Now remove this template message and explain where that message came from :)

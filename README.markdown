# About WTC (What The Commit)
Commitment is a small Tornado application that generates random commit messages.

    http://whatthecommit.com/

Commitment also provides http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt which provides plain text output.  
Some interesting usage for that can be:
```
git config --global alias.yolo '!git commit -m "$(curl -s whatthecommit.com/index.txt)"'
```

Or use the [WhatTheCommit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gaardsholt.vscode-whatthecommit) vscode extension

I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation

I forgot to commit... So here you go.
I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I hate this fucking language.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I know what I am doing. Trust me.

I must have been drunk.
I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
I really should've committed this when I finished it...
I should get a raise for this.
I should have had a V8 this morning.

I was told to leave it alone, but I have this thing called OCD, you see
I was wrong...
I will not apologize for art.
I would rather be playing SC2.

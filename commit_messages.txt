I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.
I know what I am doing. Trust me.
I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!
I made leetle mistake
I'm guessing this may start causing us problems either soon or never.

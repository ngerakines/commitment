I don't believe it
I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
I don't know why. Just move on.
i dunno, maybe this works
IEize
I expected something different.
If it's hacky and you know it clap you hands (clap clap)!
I forgot to commit... So here you go.

I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I hate this fucking language.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.
I know what I am doing. Trust me.
I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!
I'm human

This is not the commit message you are looking for
This is supposed to crash
This is the last time we let XNAMEX commit ascii porn in the comments.
This is where it all begins...
This is why git rebase is a horrible horrible thing.
This is why the cat shouldn't sit on my keyboard.
This really should not take 19 minutes to build.
this should fix it
This solves it.
This will definitely break in 20XNUM20,89X (TODO)
tl;dr
To be honest, I do not quite remember everything I changed here today. But it is all good, I tell ya.
Todo!!!
TODO: write meaningful commit message
Too lazy to write descriptive message
Too tired to write descriptive message
totally more readable
To those I leave behind, good luck!

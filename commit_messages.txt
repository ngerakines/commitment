Gotta make you understand
Gross hack because XNAMEX doesn't know how to code
Handled a particular error.

I __ a word
I am Root. We are Root.
I am Spartacus
I am even stupider than I thought
I am sorry
I am the greatest javascript developer in the world.
I can't believe it took so long to fix this.
I cannot believe that it took this long to write a test for this.
I did it for the lulz!
I don't believe it
I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
I don't know why. Just move on.
I dont know what I am doing
I expected something different.
I forgot to commit... So here you go.
I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I hate this fucking language.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I immediately regret this commit.
I just evaluated random code in my console
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
I know what I am doing. Trust me.
I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.
I made leetle mistake
I must enjoy torturing myself
I must have been drunk.
I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
I really should've committed this when I finished it...
I should get a raise for this.
I should have had a V8 this morning.
I think now it works
I transformed a bug into a feature. Once you learn how, you'll never forget it
I was told to leave it alone, but I have this thing called OCD, you see
I was wrong...
I will not apologize for art.
I would rather be playing SC2.
I'M PUSHING.
I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!
I'm guessing this may start causing us problems either soon or never.
I'm human
I'm hungry
I'm just a grunt. Don't blame me for this awful PoS.
I'm sorry.

This branch is so dirty, even your mom can't clean it.
This bug has driven lots of coders completely mad. You won't believe how it ended up being fixed
This bunny should be killed.
This commit is a lie
This changes nothing, don't look
This is a basic implementation that works.
This is my code. My code is amazing.
This is not a commit
This is not the commit message you are looking for
This is supposed to crash
This is the last time we let XNAMEX commit ascii porn in the comments.
This is where it all begins...
This is why git rebase is a horrible horrible thing.
This is why the cat shouldn't sit on my keyboard.
This really should not take 19 minutes to build.
This should work until december 2013.
This solves it.
This was the most stupid bug in the world, fixed in the smartest way ever
This will definitely break in 20XNUM20,89X (TODO)
To be honest, I do not quite remember everything I changed here today. But it is all good, I tell ya.
To those I leave behind, good luck!

XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. C++ IO SUCKS.
XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. EXPANDTAB.
Yep, XNAMEX was right on this one.
Yes, I was being sarcastic.
You can't see it, but I'm making a very angry face right now
You know the rules and so do I
You should have trusted me.
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
Your commit is writing checks your merge can't cash.

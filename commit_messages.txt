I am Root. We are Root.
I am Spartacus
I am even stupider than I thought
I am sorry
I can't believe it took so long to fix this.
I cannot believe that it took this long to write a test for this.
I did it for the lulz!
I don't believe it
I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
I don't know why. Just move on.

I forgot to commit... So here you go.
I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I hate this fucking language.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I immediately regret this commit.
I know what I am doing. Trust me.

I must have been drunk.
I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
I really should've committed this when I finished it...
I should get a raise for this.
I should have had a V8 this morning.
I transformed a bug into a feature. Once you learn how, you'll never forget it

I was wrong...
I will not apologize for art.
I would rather be playing SC2.

I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!
I'm guessing this may start causing us problems either soon or never.

Things went wrong...
This Is Why We Don't Push To Production On Fridays
This branch is so dirty, even your mom can't clean it.
This bug has driven lots of coders completely mad. You won't believe how it ended up being fixed
This bunny should be killed.
This commit is a lie
This is a basic implementation that works.
This is my code. My code is amazing.
This is not the commit message you are looking for
This is supposed to crash
This is the last time we let XNAMEX commit ascii porn in the comments.
This is where it all begins...
This is why git rebase is a horrible horrible thing.
This is why the cat shouldn't sit on my keyboard.
This should work until december 2013.
This really should not take 19 minutes to build.
This solves it.
This was the most stupid bug in the world, fixed in the smartest way ever
This will definitely break in 20XNUM20,89X (TODO)
To be honest, I do not quite remember everything I changed here today. But it is all good, I tell ya.
To those I leave behind, good luck!
Todo!!!
Too lazy to write descriptive message
Too tired to write descriptive message
Transpiled mainframe.
Trust me, I'm an engineer!... What the f*ck did just happened here?
Trust me, it's not badly written. It's just way above your head.
Trying to fake a conflict
Ugh. Bad rebase.
Update .gitignore
Updated
Updated build targets.

We should delete this crap before shipping.
We'll figure it out on Monday
Well the book was obviously wrong.
Well, it's doing something.
Whatever will be, will be 8{
Whatever.
Whee, good night.
Whee.
Who Let the Bugs Out??
Who has two thumbs and remembers the rudiments of his linear algebra courses?  Apparently, this guy.
Who knows WTF?!
Who knows...
Why The Fuck?
Working on tests (haha)
Wubbalubbadubdub!
XNAMEX broke the regex, lame
XNAMEX made me do it
XNAMEX rebase plx?
XNAMEX sucks
XUPPERNAMEX SUCKS
XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. C++ IO SUCKS.
XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. EXPANDTAB.
Yep, XNAMEX was right on this one.
Yes, I was being sarcastic.
You can't see it, but I'm making a very angry face right now
You should have trusted me.
Your commit is writing checks your merge can't cash.

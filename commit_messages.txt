I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

That last commit message about silly mistakes pales in comparision to this one
That's just how I roll
The last time I tried this the monkey didn't survive. Let's hope it works better this time.
The same thing we do every night, Pinky - try to take over the world!
Things went wrong...
This branch is so dirty, even your mom can't clean it.
This bunny should be killed.
This commit is a lie
This is a basic implementation that works.
This is not the commit message you are looking for
This is supposed to crash
This is the last time we let XNAMEX commit ascii porn in the comments.
This is where it all begins...
This is why git rebase is a horrible horrible thing.
This is why the cat shouldn't sit on my keyboard.
This really should not take 19 minutes to build.
This solves it.
This will definitely break in 20XNUM20,89X (TODO)
To be honest, I do not quite remember everything I changed here today. But it is all good, I tell ya.
To those I leave behind, good luck!
Todo!!!
Too lazy to write descriptive message
Too tired to write descriptive message
Trust me, it's not badly written. It's just way above your head.
Trying to fake a conflict

XNAMEX sucks
XUPPERNAMEX SUCKS
XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. C++ IO SUCKS.
XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. EXPANDTAB.
Yep, XNAMEX was right on this one.
Yes, I was being sarcastic.
You can't see it, but I'm making a very angry face right now
You should have trusted me.
Your commit is writing checks your merge can't cash.

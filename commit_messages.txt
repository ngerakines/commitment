Hiding API key hahaha
hmmm
Hold my beer - Testing risky changes
Hold on to your butts - Making major changes
holy shit it's functional
hoo boy
hopefully going to get a successful build got damn it
Houston, problem solved - Fixed the bug
Houston, we have a problem - Found a bug
I __ a word
I already said I was sorry
I am even stupider than I thought
I am Groot - Made a small but important change
I am one with the Force, the Force is with me - Hopeful commit before testing
I am Root. We are Root.
I am sorry
I am Spartacus
I am the greatest javascript developer in the world.
I CAN HAZ COMMENTZ.
I CAN HAZ PYTHON, I CAN HAZ INDENTS
I can't believe it took so long to fix this.
I can't believe this works - Quick and dirty fix
I cannot believe that it took this long to write a test for this.
I did it for the lulz!
I don't believe it
I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
I don't know why. Just move on.
I dont know what I am doing
i dunno, maybe this works
I expected something different.
I find your lack of tests disturbing - Encouraging better testing practices
I forgot to commit... So here you go.
I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I hate this fucking language.
I have a bad feeling about this - Pushing potentially problematic changes
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
i hid an easter egg in the code. can you find it?
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I immediately regret this commit.
I just evaluated random code in my console
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
I know what I am doing. Trust me.
I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.
I made leetle mistake
I must enjoy torturing myself
I must have been drunk.
I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
i need therapy
I really should've committed this when I finished it...
I should get a raise for this.
I should have had a V8 this morning.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good - Implemented secret feature
I swear it's not a virus - Implementing security measures
i think i fixed a bug...
I think now it works
I transformed a bug into a feature. Once you learn how, you'll never forget it
I understand that it's an antipattern, but it's convenient.
I was told to leave it alone, but I have this thing called OCD, you see
I was wrong...
I will not apologize for art.
I will run 'terraform fmt' before committing.
I would rather be playing SC2.
I'll be back - Commit before taking a break
I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!
I'll mention this again, if you're git-blaming this, don't come slap me personally. This code straight ported from another project and we WILL refactor this in the future. This is a temporary solution. OK I guess you can slap me for porting this as is, but still.
I'm guessing this may start causing us problems either soon or never.
I'm human
I'm hungry
I'm just a grunt. Don't blame me for this awful PoS.
I'M PUSHING.
I'm sorry.
I'm too foo for this bar
I'm too old for this shit!
I'm totally adding this to epic win. +300
I've got a bad case of commit-ment issues - Frequent small commits
